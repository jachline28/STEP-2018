#### Week 1: [I Can Haz Wordz](https://icanhazwordz.appspot.com/")
The Goal is to get the highest score ([see help](https://icanhazwordz.appspot.com/help)) by creating long words, and the alphabets used are limited to the ones shown on the 4x4 grid.  

Some Points:  
1. In the provided [dictionary](https://icanhazwordz.appspot.com/dictionary.words), Q are always inmediately followed by U. So character replacement is used when cleaning the strings.  
2. I was stucked in finding substring, where I (Python Newbee) thought that `` if substring in string:   `` finds the longest non-continuous, but it doesn't, I have to do it manually, pairing one by one.
3. Automated test: Selenium Webdriver on Chrome. [Chrome Driver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/) 
> useful functions in Selenium :
> > driver.find\_element\_by\_xpath()  
> > driver.find\_element\_by\_id()  
> > driver.get()
